*Tx Macros* are an aid for sending brief, frequently used free-text
 messages.

- To add a new message to the list, enter the desired text (up to 13
characters) in the entry field at top, then click *Add*.

- To remove an unwanted message, click on the message and then on
*Delete*.

- You can reorder your macro messages by using drag-and-drop. The
new order will be preserved over program invocations.
