Menus at top of the main window offer many options for configuration
and operation.  Most of the items are self-explanatory; a few
additional details are provided below.  Keyboard shortcuts for some
frequently used menu items are listed at the right edge of the menu.

==== _WSJT-X_ menu

This menu appears on the Macintosh only. *Settings* appears here,
labeled as *Preferences*, rather than on the *File* menu.  *About WSJT-X* appears here rather than on the *Help* menu.

[[FILE_MENU]]

[[CONFIG_MENU]]
==== Configuration Menu

Many users prefer to create and use entries on the *Configurations*
menu for switching between modes.  Simply *Clone* the *Default* entry,
*Rename* it as desired, and then make all desired settings for that
configuration.  These settings are restored whenever you select that configuration.

As well as switching between configurations while running _WSJT-X_, you
can also start the application from the command line in any desired
configuration.  Use the command-line option
`--config <configuration-name>`, or `-c` for short, as in these
examples for configurations `FT8` and `Echo`:

 wsjtx --config FT8
 wsjtx -c Echo

[[VIEW_MENU]]

*Active Stations* displays a window that can help you to work the most
distant stations, in particular for the distance-scored ARRL
International Digital Contest.  Controls are provided to set the
maximum length of the list and the maximum "`age`" of decodes in Rx
sequences.  You can request display of only ready-to-be-called
stations.  For the ARRL International Digital Contest the window
displays scoring rate (points in the most recent hour), total score,
and the number of band changes in the past hour.

*SWL Mode* reduces the _WSJT-X_ main window to a minimum
size with just the menus, decodes windows, and status bar visible. You
may find this useful when running multiple instances of the
application. Both size and location of the main window are saved and
recalled independently for this view.
