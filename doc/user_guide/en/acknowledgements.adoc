// Status=review

The _WSJT_ project was started by *K1JT* in 2001.  Since 2005 it has
been an Open Source project, and it has included the programs _WSJT_,
_MAP65_, _WSPR_, _WSJT-X_, and _WSPR-X_.  *G4WJS* (since 2013), *K9AN*
(since 2015), *IV3NWV* (since 2016), *KG4IYS* (since 2021), and
*DG2YCB* (since 2021) have made major contributions to _WSJT-X_.
Together with K1JT they now form the core development team.  *G4WJS*
and *W9MDB* have made major contributions to the _hamlib_ library, on
which _WSJT-X_ depends for rig control.

All code in the _WSJT_ project is licensed under the GNU Public
License (GPL).  Many users of these programs, too numerous to mention
here individually, have contributed suggestions and advice that have
greatly aided the development of _WSJT_ and its sister programs.  For
_WSJT-X_ in particular, we acknowledge contributions from *AC6SL,
AE4JY, DF2ET, DJ0OT, G3WDG, G4KLA, IW3RAB, K3WYC, KA1GT, KA6MAL, KA9Q,
KB1ZMX, KD6EKQ, KI7MT, KK1D, ND0B, PY2SDR, VE1SKY, VK3ACF, VK4BDJ,
VK7MO, W3DJS, W3SZ, W4TI, W4TV, and W9MDB*.  Each of these amateurs
has helped to bring the program’s design, code, testing, and/or
documentation to its present state.

Most of the color palettes for the _WSJT-X_ waterfall were copied from
the excellent, well documented, open-source program _fldigi_, by *W1HKJ*
and friends.

We use development tools and libraries from many sources.  We
particularly wish to acknowledge importance of the GNU Compiler
Collection from the Free Software Foundation, the "clang" compiler
from LLVM at the University of Illinois, and the Qt Project from Digia
PLC.  Other important resources include the FFTW library by Matteo
Frigo and Steven G. Johnson; SLALIB, the Positional Astronomy Library
by P. T.  Wallace; and a high-precision planetary ephemeris and
associated software from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
