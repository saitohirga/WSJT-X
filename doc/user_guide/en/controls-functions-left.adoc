Controls related to frequency selection, received audio level, the
station being called, and date and time are found in the lower,
left-hand section of the main window.  Buttons are provided for making
quick changes among the modes FT8, FT4, MSK144, Q65, and JT65, and
for toggling FT8 Hound mode ON or OFF.

* A drop-down list of frequencies and bands in the upper, left-hand corner lets you
select the operating band. It also sets dial frequency to a value taken from the *Frequencies* tab on the *Settings* window.  If CAT control
is active, the radio's dial frequency is set accordingly; if not,
you must tune the radio manually.

* Alternatively, you can enter a frequency (in MHz) or band name in
recognized ADIF format, for example 630m, 20m, or 70cm.  The band-name
format works only if a working frequency has been set for that band
and mode, in which case the first such match is selected.

* You can also enter a frequency increment in kHz above the currently
displayed integer MHz. For example, if the displayed frequency is
10,368.100, enter `165k` (don't forget the `k`!) to QSY to 10,368.165.

* A small colored circle appears in green if the CAT control is
activated and functional.  The green circle contains the character S
if the rig is detected to be in *Split* mode.  The circle becomes red
if you have requested CAT control but communication with the radio has
been lost.

TIP: Many Icom rigs cannot be queried for split status, current VFO or
split transmit frequency. When using _WSJT-X_ with such radios you
should not change the current VFO, split status or dial frequency
using controls on the radio.

* If *DX Grid* contains a valid Maidenhead locator, the corresponding
great-circle azimuth and distance from your location are displayed.

* The program can maintain a database of callsigns and locators for
future reference.  Click *Add* to insert the present call and locator
in the database; click *Lookup* to retrieve the locator for a
previously stored call.  This feature is mainly useful for situations
in which the number of active stations is modest and reasonably
stable, such as EME (Earth-Moon-Earth) communication.  The callsign
file name is `CALL3.TXT`.
