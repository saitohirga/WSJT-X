[[TUTORIAL]]
== Basic Operating Tutorial

This section introduces the basic user controls and program behavior
of _WSJT-X_, with particular emphasis on the JT9, JT65, and FT8 modes.
We suggest that new users should go through the full HF-oriented
tutorial, preferably while at your radio.  Note that as of late 2018,
digital usage on the HF bands has mostly moved from JT65 and JT9 to FT8.  So
you may wish to pay particular attention to *FT8*, in Section 6.6.

Subsequent sections cover additional details on <<MAKE_QSOS,Making
QSOs>>, <<WSPR,WSPR mode>> and <<VHF_AND_UP,VHF+ Features>>.
