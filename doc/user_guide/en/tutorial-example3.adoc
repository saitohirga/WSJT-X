.Main Window:
- Select *FT8* on the *Mode* menu.
- Set Tx frequency to 1600 Hz, Rx to 1442 Hz.
- Double-click on *Erase* to clear both text windows.

.Wide Graph Settings:

- *Bins/Pixel* = 4, *Start* = 200 Hz, *N Avg* = 2
- Adjust the width of the Wide Graph window so that the upper
frequency limit is approximately 2600 Hz.

.Open a Wave File:

- Select *File | Open* and navigate to
+...\save\samples\FT8\181201_180245.wav+.  The waterfall and Band
Activity window should look something like the following screen shots.
(This recording was made during the "FT8 Roundup" contest, so most
transmissions happen to be using *RTTY Roundup* message formats.)

- Click with the mouse anywhere on the waterfall display. The green Rx
frequency marker will jump to your selected frequency, and the Rx
frequency control on the main window will be updated accordingly.

- Do the same thing with the *Shift* key held down.  Now the red Tx
frequency marker and its associated control on the main window will
follow your frequency selections.

- Do the same thing with the *Ctrl* key held down.  Now the both colored 
markers and both spinner controls will follow your selections.

- Double-clicking at any frequency on the waterfall does all the
things just described and also invokes the decoder in a small range
around the Rx frequency.  To decode a particular signal, double-click
near the left edge of its waterfall trace.

- Now double-click on any of the the lines of decoded text in the Band
Activity window.  Any line will show the same behavior, setting
Rx frequency to that of the selected message and leaving Tx frequency
unchanged.  To change both Rx and Tx frequencies, hold *Ctrl* down
when double-clicking.

TIP: To avoid QRM from competing callers, it is frequently desirable
to answer a CQ on a different frequency from that of the CQing
station.  The same is true when you tail-end another QSO.  Choose a Tx
frequency that appears to be not in use.  You might want to check the
box *Hold Tx Freq*.

TIP: Keyboard shortcuts *Shift+F11* and *Shift+F12* provide an easy
way to move your Tx frequency down or up in 60 Hz steps.

TIP: An online {ft8_tips} by ZL2IFB offers many helpful tips on
operating procedures.

.FT8 DXpedition Mode:

This special operating mode enables DXpeditions to make FT8 QSOs at
very high rates.  Both stations must use _WSJT-X_ Version 1.9 or
later.  Detailed operating instructions for {ft8_DXped} are available
online.  Do not try to use DXpedition mode without reading these
instructions carefully!

IMPORTANT: FT8 DXpedition mode is intended for use by rare-entity
DXpeditions and other unusual circumstances in which sustained QSO
rates well above 100/hour are expected.  Do not use the multi-signal
capability unless you satisfy this requirement, and do not use
DXpedition Mode in the conventional FT8 sub-bands.  If you are
contemplating operation as Fox using DXpedition Mode, find a suitable
dial frequency consistent with regional band plans and publicize it
for the operators you hope to work.  Remember that on-the-air signal
frequencies will be higher than the dial frequency by up to 4 kHz.

IMPORTANT: When finished with this Tutorial, don't forget to re-enter
your own callsign as *My Call* on the *Settings | General* tab.
