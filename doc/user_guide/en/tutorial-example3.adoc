.Main Window:
- Select *FT8* on the *Mode* menu.
- Set Tx and Rx frequencies to 1200 Hz.
- Double-click on *Erase* to clear both text windows.

.Wide Graph Settings:

- *Bins/Pixel* = 4, *Start* = 200 Hz, *N Avg* = 2
- Adjust the width of the Wide Graph window so that the upper
frequency limit is approximately 2600 Hz.

.Open a Wave File:

- Select *File | Open* and navigate to
+...\save\samples\FT8\170709_135615.wav+.  The waterfall and decoded
text window should look something like the following screen shots:

- Click with the mouse anywhere on the waterfall display. The green Rx
frequency marker will jump to your selected frequency, and the Rx
frequency control on the main window will be updated accordingly.

- Do the same thing with the *Shift* key held down.  Now the red Tx
frequency marker and its associated control on the main window will
follow your frequency selections.

- Do the same thing with the *Ctrl* key held down.  Now the both colored 
markers and both spinner controls will follow your selections.

- Double-clicking at any frequency on the waterfall does all the
things just described and also invokes the decoder in a small range
around the Rx frequency.  To decode a particular signal, double-click
near the left edge of its waterfall trace.

- Now double-click on any of the the lines of decoded text in the main
window.  All three lines will show the same behavior, setting Rx
frequency to that of the selected message and leaving Tx frequency
unchanged.  To change both Rx and Tx frequencies, hold *Ctrl* down
when double-clicking.

NOTE: To avoid QRM from competing callers, it is frequently desirable
to answer a CQ on a different frequency from that of the CQing
station.  The same is true when you tail-end another QSO.  Choose a Tx
frequency that appears to be not in use.

NOTE: Keyboard shortcuts *Shift+F11* and *Shift+F12* provide an easy
way to move your Tx frequency down or up in 60 Hz steps.

NOTE: Further helpful tips on FT8 operating procedures are available
{ft8_tips}.  Thanks to ZL2IFB!

.FT8 DXpedition Mode:

- This special operating mode enables DXpeditions to make FT8 QSOs at
very high rates.  Both stations must use _WSJT-X_ Version 1.9 or
later.  Detailed operating instructions can be found {ft8_DXped}.
Do not try to use DXpedition mode without reading these instructions
carefully!
