// Status=edited

A *Status Bar* at the bottom edge of the main window provides useful
information about operating conditions.

Labels on the *Status Bar* display such information as the program's
current operating state, configuration name, operating mode, and the
content of your most recent transmitted message. The first label
(operating state) can be Receiving, Tx (for Transmitting), Tx: Tune, or
the name of the file opened from the *File* menu. This label is
highlighted in green for Receiving, yellow for Tx, red for Tune, and
light blue for a file name.  When transmitting, the Tx message is
displayed exactly as it will be decoded by receiving stations.  The
second label (as shown above) will be absent if you are using the
*Default* setting on the *Configurations* menu.  A progress bar shows
the elapsed fraction of a Tx or Rx sequence.  Finally, if the Watchdog
(WD) timer was enabled on the *Files | Settings | General* tab, a label in the
lower right-hand corner displays the number of minutes remaining
before timeout.

TIP: Temporary status messages may occasionally be displayed here for
a few seconds when background processing completes.
