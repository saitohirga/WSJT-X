=== Help with Setup

The best source of help in setting up your station or configuring
_WSJT-X_ is the {wsjtx_group} at email address
wsjtx@groups.io.  The chances are good that someone with
similar interests and equipment has already solved your problem and
will be happy to help.  To post messages here you will need to
{wsjt-devel}.

=== Bug Reports

One of your responsibilities as a _WSJT-X_ user is to help the
volunteer programmers to make the program better.  Bugs may be
reported to the WSJTX forum on Groups.io {wsjtgroup_mail} or the WSJT
Developers list (wsjt-devel@lists.sourceforge.net).  Again, you will
need to {wsjtx_group2} or {wsjt-devel2}. 

To be useful, bug reports should include at least the following
information:

- Program version
- Operating system
- Concise description of the problem
- Exact sequence of steps required to reproduce the problem

=== Feature Requests

Suggestions from users often result in new program features.  Good
ideas are always welcome: if there's a feature you would like to see
in _WSJT-X_, spell it out in as much detail as seems useful and send
it to us at one of the email addresses given a few lines above.  Be
sure to explain why you think the feature is desirable, and what sort
of other users might find it so.
