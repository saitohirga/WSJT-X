- Execute the downloaded file and follow its installation 
instructions.

- Install _WSJT-X_ into its own directory rather than the conventional
location +C:\Program Files\WSJTX+.  The suggested default directory is
+C:\WSJTX+.

- All files relating to _WSJT-X_ will be stored in your chosen
installation directory and its subdirectories. You can uninstall
_WSJT-X_ by removing the installation directory and its contents.

- The built-in Windows facility for time synchronization is usually
not adequate.  We recommend Meinberg NTP: see {ntpsetup} for
downloading and installation instructions.  

- _WSJT-X_ expects your sound card to do its raw sampling at 48000 Hz.
To ensure that this will be so when running under recent versions of
Windows, open the system's sound control panel and select in turn the
*Recording* and *Playback* options.  Click on *Properties*, then
*Advanced*, and select ``16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality).''

CAUTION: If you are using a sound card that is also the default device
for Windows sounds, be sure to turn off all such sounds so they are
not transmitted over the air.
