The following controls appear at the bottom of the Wide Graph window.
With the exception of *JT65 nnnn JT9*, they affect only the graphical
displays — they have no effect on the decoding process.

- *Bins/Pixel* controls the displayed frequency resolution.  Set
to 1 for the highest possible resolution, or to higher values to
compress the spectral display. Normal operation with a convenient
window size works well at 2 to 8 bins per pixel.

- *JT65 nnnn JT9* sets the dividing point for wide-band decoding of
JT65 and JT9 signals in JT9+JT65 mode.  The decoder looks for JT65
signals below nnnn Hz and JT9 signals above that frequency.

- *Start nnn Hz* sets the low-frequency starting point of the
waterfall frequency scale.

- *N Avg* is the number of successive FFTs to be averaged before
updating the spectral display.  Values around 5 are suitable for
normal JT9 and JT65 operation.

- *Zero* and *Gain* control the scaling and reference level for
waterfall colors.  Values around 0 for both parameters are usually
about right, depending on the input signal level and your own
preferences.

- *Palette* lets you select from a number of waterfall color palettes.

- Check the *Flatten* box to have _WSJT-X_ compensate for uneven
spectral response across the received passband.

- You can select *Current* or *Cumulative* for the spectrum displayed
in the bottom one-third of the Wide Graph window.  *Current* is the
average spectrum over the most recent *N Avg* FFT calculations.
*Cumulative* is the average spectrum since the start of the current
minute.
