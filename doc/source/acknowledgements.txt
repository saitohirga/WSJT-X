// Status=review
- Many users of WSJT, too numerous to mention here individually, have
contributed suggestions and advice that have greatly aided the
development of {wsjtx} and its sister programs.  Since 2005 the
overall project (including WSJT, MAP65, WSPR, {wsjtx}, and WSPR-X) has
been “open source”, all code being licensed under the GNU Public
License (GPL).

- For {wsjtx} in particular, I wish to acknowledge contributions from:
*AC6SL, AE4JY, DJ0OT, G4KLA, G4WJS, K3WYC, KA6MAL, KA9Q, KK1D, PY2SDR,
VK3ACF, VK4BDJ, and W4TV*.

- Each has helped to bring the program’s design, code, and
documentation to its present state. Most of the color palettes for the
{wsjtx} waterfall were shamelessly copied from the excellent, well
documented, open-source program fldigi, by W1HKJ and friends.
