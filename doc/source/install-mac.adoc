Two different packages are available: one for OS X 10.6 through 10.8,
and one for OS X 10.9. The two packages are _not_ interchangeable.

- Select the correct package for your OS X and download it to your desktop.
** {osx-108}
** {osx-109}

- Double-click on the file to see a new folder, +WSJT-X+.  Drop down
into that folder, where a +Readme+ file provides detailed instructions
on how to configure your system for _WSJT-X_.

- Additional information from package developer G4KLA 
can be found {osx-instructions}.

// Any necessary instructions about time synchronization or sound setup ??
