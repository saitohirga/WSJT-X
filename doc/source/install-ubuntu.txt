- Installation packages for Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, 13.04, 13.10 are
available at {launchpadurl}

- If you have not before obtained packages from the Personal Package
Archive (PPA) at the above link, execute the following instruction at
the command prompt:

 $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jnogatch/wsjtx

- Accept the PPA Key, then:

 $ sudo apt-get update 
 $ sudo apt-get install wsjtx

- Download the soft-decision Reed Solomon decoder {kvasd} and put it
in the same directory as the executable binaries wsjtx and
jt9. Normally (fter you have run the script /usr/bin/wsjtx at least
once) this directory will be $HOME/.wsjtx.
