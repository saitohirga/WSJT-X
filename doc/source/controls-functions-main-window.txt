* *Log QSO* pops up a confirmation screen pre-filled with known
information about a QSO you have nearly completed.  You can edit or
add to this information before clicking OK to log the QSO.  If you
select ``Prompt me to log QSO'' on the Setup menu, the program will
pop up the confirmation screen automatically when you send a ``73'' or
free-text message.

* *Stop* will stop normal data acquisition in case you want to open
and explore previously recorded audio files.

* *Monitor* restarts normal receive operation.  This button is
highlighted in green when the program is receiving.

* *Decode* tells the program to repeat the decoding procedure at the
Rx frequency (green marker on waterfall), using the most recently
completed sequence of Rx data.

* *Erase* clears the right (Rx frequency) window. Double-clicking
Erase clears both text windows.

* *Tune* may be used to switch into Tx mode and generate an
unmodulated carrier at the specified Tx frequency (red marker on
waterfall).  This process may be seful for adjusting an antenna tuner,
for example, toggle the button a second time to terminate the Tune
process.

* *Enable Tx* puts the program into automatic Rx/Tx sequencing mode
and highlights the button in red.  A transmission will start at the
beginning of the selected (odd or even) sequence, or immediately if
appropriate.

* *Halt Tx* terminates a transmission in progress and disables
automatic Rx/Tx sequencing.
