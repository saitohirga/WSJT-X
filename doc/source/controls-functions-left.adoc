* The drop-down list of bands at upper left lets you select the
operating band and sets dial frequency to a default value taken from
the *Default Frequencies* tab on the *Setup | Configuration* screen.
If CAT control is active the radio's dial frequency will be set
accordingly; if not, you must tune the radio manually.

* If you are using CAT control, a small colored square appears in
green if the CAT control is two-way between _WSJT-X_ and your radio, or
orange if the control is only from program to radio.  (You can request
a one-time interrogation of the radio’s dial frequency by clicking on
the orange square.) The square becomes red if you have requested CAT
control but communication with the radio has been lost.  If the
locator *Dx Grid* is known, the great-circle azimuth and distance are
displayed.

* The program can keep a database of call-signs and locators for
future reference.  Click *Add* to insert the present call and locator in
the database; click *Lookup* to retrieve the locator for a previously
stored call.
