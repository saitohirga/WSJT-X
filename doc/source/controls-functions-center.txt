At the center of the main window are a number of controls you will
use when making QSOs:

//.Misc Controls Center

* Select *Tx even* to transmit in even-numbered UTC minutes.  Uncheck
this box to transmit in the odd intervals.  This selection is made
automatically when you double-click on a decoded text line as
described in the Basic Operating Tutorial.

* Your audio Tx and Rx frequencies can be adjusted with spinner
controls. These settings are usually handled automatically by the
double-click procedure.

* The on-the-air frequency of your lowest JT9 or JT65 tone is the sum
of dial and audio frequencies.  You can force Tx frequency to the
current Rx frequency by clicking the *Tx=Rx* button, and vice-versa
for *Rx=Tx*.  Check the box *Lock Tx=Rx* to make the frequencies
always track one another.

* The *Report* control lets you change a signal report that has been
inserted automatically. Most reports will fall in the range –26 to
+10 dB.  Remember that JT65 reports cannot be greater than -1 dB.

IMPORTANT: When signals are close to or above 0 dB, you and your QSO
partner should probably reduce power. JT65 and JT9 are supposed to be
weak signal modes!
