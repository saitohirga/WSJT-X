		  Release: WSJT-X 2.2.2
		       June 22, 2020
		  ---------------------

WSJT-X v2.2.2 is a bug fix release, mainly to incorporate the new RAC
section PE into the FT8/FT4/MSK144 Contest Mode for Field Day.

 - Stations intending to operate in Field Day (FD) are urged to
   upgrade to this release, without it you cannot set your section to
   PE, and of equal importance you cannot decode contest messages from
   stations who are operating from PE without this upgrade.

 - FT8 decoder speeded up in Normal and Fast modes. This change gives
   a speed of decoding closer to that of v2.1.2 without compromising
   the number of decodes. It is particularly targeted for slower
   single board computer users such as the Raspberry Pi Model 3 or
   similar.

 - Thanks to our user interface language translation contributors for
   many improvements to the translated strings.

 - The DX Grid field is now cleared automatically when the DX Call
   field is changed. Care should be taken to complete entry of a
   callsign before entering a grid square.


		  Release: WSJT-X 2.2.1
		       June 6, 2020
		  ---------------------

WSJT-X v2.2.1 is a bug fix release that fixes regressions found in the
prior v2.2.0 release. Here is a brief summary;

 - Incorporate a revised Hamlib version the address a regression in
   rig control of some rigs including the Yaesu FT-991 and FT-891.

 - Repair a defect in 6 character gridsquare lookup from the CALL3.TXT
   database, and improve "Lookup" button processing.

 - Repair a defect with selecting Wide Graph 2D spectrum types in
   translated UIs.

 - Repair a regression that blocked the Highlight Callsign UDP request
   from highlighting terms including a '+' character.

 - Repair a defect that caused hash code lookups of one's own call to
   fail after an extended period of inactivity, when operating with a
   non-standard callsign.

 - Repair  a  regression  where   occasional  Highlight  Callsign  UDP
   requests with the 'Highlight last'  parameter as true highlighted a
   match in a prior period. This fix include a performance improvement
   when  processing any  Highlight  Callsign  request with  'Highlight
   last' as true.

 - Include support for the Yaesu FT-920 when controlled by Ham Radio
   Deluxe. This change inadvertently missed the v2.2.0 GA release.

 - Correct a documentation issue with the UDP Message Protocol
   Status(1) message Special Operations Mode enumeration values ("WW
   DIGI added", Fox, and Hound renumbered). Thanks to Sam, W2JDB, for
   raising this issue.

 - Updated Catalan UI translation, tnx Xavi, EA3W.

 - Italian UI translation, tnx Marco, PY1ZRJ.

 - Updated Spanish UI translation, tnx Cédric, EA4AC. 


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.2
		       June 2, 2020
		   -------------------

WSJT-X 2.2 is a program upgrade that provides a number of new features
and capabilities.  Here is a brief summary; for further details see
the notes for candidate releases 2.2.0-rc1, -rc2, and -rc3, below, and
of course the updated WSJT-X 2.2 User Guide.

 - Significant improvements to the decoders for FT4, FT8, JT4, JT65,
   and WSPR.

 - New format for "EU VHF Contest" Tx2 and Tx3 messages

   When "EU VHF Contest" is selected, the Tx2 and Tx3 messages (those  
   conveying signal report, serial number, and 6-character locator)
   now use hashcodes for both callsigns.  This change is NOT backward
   compatible with earlier versions of _WSJT-X_, so all users of EU
   VHF Contest messages should be sure to upgrade to version 2.2.0.

 - Accessibility

   Keyboard shortcuts have been added as an aid to accessibility:
   Alt+R sets Tx4 message to RR73, Ctrl+R sets it to RRR.

   As an aid for partial color-blindness, the "inverted goal posts"
   marking Rx frequency on the Wide Graph's frequency scale are now
   rendered in a darker shade of green.

 - User Interface Translations have been enabled.  Translations are
   now available for Catalan, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Hong
   Kong Chinese.  Additiional languages will follow, when available.

   Note that UI translation is automatic, based on your system primary
   language. If you do not want the WSJT-X UI translated to your local
   language then start WSJT-X with the '--language=en' command line
   option:

   wsjtx --language=en

   If you wish to contribute by authoring WSJT-X UI translations
   please join the new discussion group wsjtx-l10n@Groups.io
   (https://groups.io/g/wsjtx-l10n), where help from other translation
   authors and coordination with the development team is available.

 - Minor enhancements and bug fixes

   "Save None" now writes no .wav files to disk, even temporarily.

   An explicit entry for "WW Digi Contest" has been added to
   "Special operating activities" on the "Settings | Advanced" tab.

   Contest mode FT4 now always uses RR73 for the Tx4 message.

   The Status bar now displays the number of decodes found in the
   most recent Rx sequence.

   The "Highlight Callsign" UDP message has been enhanced to allow
   clearing of old highlighting for a specified callsign. Please note
   a recommended restriction on the use of this message in the
   documentation here: https://tinyurl.com/y85nc3tg

 - Hamlib - this library which we use for direct rig control has had
   many defect repairs and enhancements, we thank the contributors to
   that project for their work.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc3
		          May 29, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc3 is the third release candidate for WSJT-X 2.2.0.

The most important differences from the -rc2 version are the
correction of regressions in hamlib code that affected particular
radios and PTT keying by means of DTR or RTS on a COM port.

In addition, RC3 has the following enhancements and minor bug fixes:

 - Updates to Catalan translation of the UI (thanks to EA3W)
 - Spanish translation of the UI (EA3W)
 - Load language translations only when matching primary language
 - Minor corrections to User Guide
 - Increased FT8 sync threshold in "Normal" and "Fast" decoding
 - Corrected the code that restores the WideGraph, EchoGraph, and
   FastGraph windows to normal view after they have been minimized.
 - Don't allow restart with "ISCAT B" mode label unless VHF features
   are enabled.
 - Repair regression defect in WSPR power combo box items


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc2
		          May 25, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc2 is a release candidate for WSJT-X 2.2.0.  The
following bugs present in the -rc1 version have been fixed:

 - Missing blank line between some decode sequences.
 - Improper functioning of "Start new period decodes at top".
 - Font selection caused crash on some macOS systems.
 - Mouse action in band selector box not right in some macOS systems.
 - Incorrect recall of Tx power setting in WSPR mode.
 - Many fixes to hamlib library and executables (rigctld, etc.).
 - Some regional settings did not allow WSJT-X to start.
 - Main window "looked like old Windows" in macOS.
 - Crash when "Ref Spec" is selected and no refspec.dat available.
 - Improper decoding of some FT4 messages with hashed "MyCall".
 - Crash after warning message about double-clicking in ISCAT mode.

In addition, we have made the following improvements:

 - Updated some figures and text in User Guide.
 - Corrected some formatting issues in the pdf version of User Guide.
 - Added some new sample files.
 - Improved shape and position of "green goal post" in Wide Graph.
 - Significantly reduced the rate of false decodes in FT4 and FT8.
 - Allow FT4 to use NA VHF Contest message formats.
 - Hold Tx frequency no longer cleared when switching between modes.
 - Added capability for translations of the user interface into
   languages other than English.  First working example (special
   thanks to Xavi Perez, EA3W!), is Catalan.  Spanish will be next.
 - Performance improvements to decode highlighting via UDP messages.

And finally:

Increasing FT8 usage on the popular bands 40, 30, and 20m means that
the default 3 kHz sub-bands are often wall-to-wall with signals.
Overcrowding encourages some to turn on their amplifiers, which only
makes things worse.  We are trying to coordinate the suggested
frequencies in WSJT-X with updated band plans being considered by
IARU, ARRL, and other amateur radio societies.

On a trial basis, and in response to numerous suggestions from around
the world, we have added a second set of suggested dial frequencies
for FT8 on three HF bands and also on 6 meters. The new suggested dial
frequencies are 7.071, 10.133, 14.071, and 50.310 MHz.  These
frequencies will appear in your drop-down band-selector list after you
go to the "Settings | Frequencies" tab, right-click on the frequency
table, and select "Reset".  Alternatively, you can add the new FT8
frequencies manually.

When the conventional FT8 sub-band on 6, 20, 30, or 40 m seems too
full, please try moving your dial frequency down 3 kHz!  Be aware that
as currently implemented, WSJT-X will set your dial to the lowest
frequency for the selected mode and band, when you switch bands.

See the next section for a list of other program improvements since
WSJT-X 2.1.2.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc1
		          May 10, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc1 is a beta-quality release candidate for a program
upgrade that provides a number of new features and capabilities.  These
include:

  - Improvements to the decoders for five modes:
 
      FT4: Corrected bugs that prevented AP decoding and/or multi-pass
      decoding in some circumstances.  The algorithm for AP
      decoding has been improved and extended.

      FT8: Decoding is now spread over three intervals.  The first
      starts at t = 11.8 s into an Rx sequence and typically yields
      around 85% of the possible decodes for the sequence.  You
      therefore see most decodes much earlier than before.  A second
      processing step starts at 13.5 s, and the final one at 14.7 s.
      Overall decoding yield on crowded bands is improved by 10% or
      more.  (Systems with receive latency greater than 0.2 s will see
      smaller improvements, but will still see many decodes earlier
      than before.)

      JT4: Formatting and display of Averaged and Deep Search decodes
      has been cleaned up and made consistent with other modes.
      Together with JT65 and QRA64, JT4 remains one of the digital
      modes widely for EME and other extreme weak-signal work on
      microwave bands.

      JT65: Many improvements for Averaged and Deep Search decodes and
      their display to the user.  These improvements are particularly
      important for EME on VHF and UHF bands.

      WSPR: Significant improvements have been made to the WSPR
      decoder's sensitivity, its ability to cope with many signals in
      a crowded sub-band, and its rate of undetected false decodes.
      We now use up to three decoding passes.  Passes 1 and 2 use
      noncoherent demodulation of single symbols and allow for
      frequency drifts up to Â±4 Hz in a transmission.  Pass 3 assumes
      no drift and does coherent block detection of up to three
      symbols.  It also applies bit-by-bit normalization of the
      single-symbol bit metrics, a technique that has proven helpful
      for signals corrupted by artifacts of the subtraction of
      stronger signals and also for LF/MF signals heavily contaminated
      by lightning transients.  With these improvements the number of
      decodes in a crowded WSPR sub-band typically increases by 10 to
      15%.

 - New format for "EU VHF Contest" Tx2 and Tx3 messages

      When "EU VHF Contest" is selected, the Tx2 and Tx3 messages
      (those conveying signal report, serial number, and 6-character
      locator) now use hashcodes for both callsigns.  This change is
      NOT backward compatible with earlier versions of _WSJT-X_, so
      all users of EU VHF Contest messages should be sure to upgrade
      to versiion 2.2.0.

 - Accessibility

      Keyboard shortcuts have been added as an aid to accessibility:
      Alt+R sets Tx4 message to RR73, Ctrl+R sets it to RRR.

      As an aid for partial color-blindness, the "inverted goal posts"
      marking Rx frequency on the Wide Graph's frequency scale are now
      rendered in a darker shade of green.

 - Minor enhancements and bug fixes

      "Save None" now writes no .wav files to disk, even temporarily.

      An explicit entry for "WW Digi Contest" has been added to
      "Special operating activities" on the "Settings | Advanced" tab.

      Contest mode FT4 now always uses RR73 for the Tx4 message.

      The Status bar now displays the number of decodes found in the
      most recent Rx sequence.

Release candidate WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc1 will be available for beta-testing
for one month starting on May 10, 2020.  We currently plan a General
Availability (GA) release of WSJT-X 2.2.0 on June 1, 2020.

For those looking even farther ahead: We are well along in the
development of two new modes designed for the LF and MF bands.  One
mode is for WSPR-like activity and one for making 2-way QSOs.  Both
use Low-density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, 4-GFSK modulation, and
two-minute T/R sequences.  The QSO mode reaches threshold SNR
sensitivity around -31 dB on the AWGN channel, and the WSPR-like mode
better than -32 dB.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.1.1
		     November 25, 2019
		   ---------------------

		       Release: WSJT-X 2.0
		        December 10, 2018
		     -----------------------

WSJT-X 2.0 is a major update that introduces new protocols for FT8 and
MSK144.  The new protocols become the world-wide standards on December
10, 2018.

WSJT-X 2.0 cannot communicate in these modes with other stations using
WSJT-X v1.9.1 or earlier.

Please help by urging everyone to upgrade no later than January 1, 2019.

New features since WSJT-X v1.9.1:

1. Compound and nonstandard callsigns are automatically recognized and
handled using new message formats.

2. The new FT8 protocol provides optimized message formats for North
American VHF contests, European VHF contests, ARRL Field Day, and ARRL
RTTY Roundup.  Similarly, the new MSK144 protocol provides optimized
message formats for North American VHF and European VHF contests.
Full support is provided for "/R" and "/P" calls in the relevant
contests.

3. The new protocols provide nearly equal (or better) sensitivity
compared to the old ones, and lower false decode rates.

4. New logging features are provided for contesting and for "Fox"
(DXpedition) mode.  Logging is optionally integrated with N1MM Logger+
and WriteLog.

5. Color highlighting of decoded messages provides worked-before
status for callsigns, grid locators, DXCC entities, continents, CQ
Zones, and ITU zones on a â€œby bandâ€ and â€œby modeâ€ basis, and for
stations that have uploaded their logs to Logbook of the World (LoTW)
within a specified time interval.

6. The WSPR decoder now achieves decodes down to S/N = -31 dB.  For
the particular benefit of LF/MF users, an option "No own call decodes"
has been added.

7. The UDP messages sent to companion programs have been expanded and
improved.

Some details of changes since WSJT-X-rc5 include the following:

 - Initial load of ADIF log in background
 - Correct the UTC displayed in Fox/Contest log
 - Faster entry and correct scrolling for Fox/Contest log
 - Add contest exchanges and contest type to UDP logged QSO message
 - Fix a bug that suppressed decodes with negative DT.
 - AK and HI are DXCCs, not states, for RTTY Roundup
 - Fix improper truncation of some non-FT8 messages in ALL.TXT
 - Various minor bug fixes and code cleanup
 - Update the WSJT-X User Guide to v2.0 (more to come...)

		     Release: WSJT-X 2.0-rc5
		        November 26, 2018
		     -----------------------

Release Candidate 5 ("RC5") is stable, works well, and fixes the known
problems in RC4.  It is likely that the General Availability (GA)
release of WSJT-X 2.0 will be nearly identical to RC5.

Changes from WSJT-X 2.0-rc4 include the following:

 -  Make the "Auto Seq" checkbox sticky, again
 -  Remove the 5-minute mouse timer
 -  Correct the "worked before" logic for color highlighting
 -  Add "No own call decodes" checkbox in WSPR mode
 -  Display and log UTC (not local time) in contest operations
 -  Validate contest QSO details before allowing logging
 -  Force Aqua theme on macOS to avoid issues with Mojave dark theme
 -  Move Fox log Reset action to Fox log window context menu
 -  Improve layout of Working Frequencies and Station Information tables
 -  Allow deletes and editing in Fox and Contest log windows
 -  Add Tool Tips for Fox and Contest log windows
 -  Fix a bug causing false AP decodes in JT65 VHF+ operation
 -  Fix a bug that could switch unexpectedly from JT65 to JT9 mode

PLEASE NOTE: As far as WSJT-X 2.0 (RC4, RC5, and GA releases) are
concerned, signals using the old FT8 protocol are undecodable
interference.  This means that regenerated replicas cannot be
subtracted from received data, and consequently second- and third-pass
decodes may be impeded.  Full performance of the 77-bit decoder will
not be realized until most signals on a crowded band are using the
new FT8 protocol.

   nonstandard call.

 - Fixed a bug that generated incorrect MSK144 tones for certain
   messages and caused a "memory" effect on stations receiving the
   incorrect tones.

wsjt-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.  You must be a subscriber in order
to post there.


		Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0
		       October 27, 2017
		-----------------------------

This is the full General Availability release of WSJT-X Version 1.8.0.

Changes from WSJT-X Version 1.8.0-rc3 are very minor:

 - Right-click on the Wide Graph now pops up a Context Menu.  Select
   the item *Set Rx & Tx Offset* to complete a one-handed setting of
   both red and green frequency markers.

 - Several clarifications and additions to Tool Tips and the User Guide.


We recommend that all users should upgrade to WSJT-X Version 1.8.0.

If you upgrade from v1.8.0-rc1 it may be necessary to do a one-time
reset of the default list of suggested operating frequencies.  Go to
*File->Settings->Frequencies*, right click on the table and select
*Reset*.


		Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0-rc3
		        October 16, 2017
		---------------------------------

Most (but not all) changes since Version 1.8.0-rc2 involve user
control of the increasingly popular FT8 mode.  The "RC3" release also
includes minor bug fixes and updates to the WSJT-X User Guide.  

The following list includes all of the more important changes:

- New optimization of GUI for simplex and split behavior in FT8 mode.

    1. Checkbox "Lock Tx Freq" on main window is relabeled "Hold Tx Freq".

    2. Double-clicking on decoded messages that do not contain your own
    call moves both Rx and Tx frequencies.  If the first callsign is
    your own call, only Rx freq moves.

    3. Double-clicking on decoded messages moves the Rx frequency.  If
    "Hold Tx Freq" is checked, Tx frequency is moved only if CTRL was
    held down.

    4. Clicking on the waterfall moves Rx and Tx frequencies as
    before: Rx only on a simple click, Tx only on SHIFT-click, and
    both on CTRL-click.  This happens even if "Hold Tx Freq" is
    checked. 

- Add a semi-automated "FreqCal" procedure: see *Solve for calibration
parameters* on the Tools menu.

- Improv auto-sequencing behavior: stop and on-frequency
transmission if a called station comes back to someone else.

- Improve S/N estimation in some situations involving QRM.

- Fix an initialization issue with user-modified application fonts.

- Fix an issue with Tx5 message generation with Type 2 compound calls.

- Enhance and improve the ADIF parser of logbook records.  Update
the band limits as per ADIF 3.0.6 specification.

- Increase the FT8 DT range to +/- 2.5 s.

- Do not allow window manager events to close the astronomical data
window.

- Add an "Erase" item to the context (right-click) menu for decoded
text.

- Extend UDP messages with an "off air" boolean field indicating that
the decode was derived from a .WAV file playback rather than an on air
reception.

- Extend reference applications to use the new off air decode message
field.

- Improve performance of FT8 decoder, especially for overlapping
signals.

- Allow specialized use of "x2 Tone Spacing" in FT8 and slow JT9
modes.

- Move "NA VHF Contest Mode" checkbox to main screen.  Query the
operator if d > 10000 km.

- Adjust UI to improve portability with font size changes and between
platforms.

- Extend UDP Reply message to support keyboard modifiers.  This allows
UDP servers to emulate keyboard modified double-clicks on decoded
messages, e.g. ALT+double-click for replying to a CQ or QRZ call
without changing ones Tx frequency offset.

- Update the cty.dat file (21st Sept 2017).

- Ensure that Fast Graph is properly initialized.

- Better handling of worked before and country name display.  Appended
text is added at a fixed column unless the message overlaps in which
case the appended information floats to the right.

- Restore printing of MSK144 decode quality information.

- Display Echo Graph automatically when Echo mode is started.

- Fix a bug that prevented double-click on a JT65 EME-style "OOO"
message from populating the Tx message boxes.

- Fixed behavior with double-click on 'CQ <AA-ZZ> <call> <grid>.'

- Update the "blank line" divider with band ID at 4*TRperiod/5.

- Fix cty.dat lookups that were not honouring exact match flags

- Add some further Copyright protections.

- Fix a bug involving "firstcall contains mycall" but not equal to mycall.

- Fix an issue with editing IARU regions in the working frequencies table.




		Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0-rc2
		        September 2, 2017
		---------------------------------

Implementation of FT8 and its auto-sequencing feature is now more
capable and more polished.  The decoder is faster and better: it now
includes signal subtraction, multi-pass decoding, and the use of
accumulated "a priori" information as a QSO progresses.  Sensitivity
extends downward as far as -24 dB in some circumstances.  Overlapping
signals 2 and 3 deep are frequently decoded at essentially the same
frequency.  On a crowded band we sometimes see more than 30 decodes in
a single 15-second interval, over a 2 kHz window.  The North American
VHF Contesting Mode has been extended to include both FT8 and MSK144
modes.

The "RC2" release also includes many minor bug fixes and an
extensively updated WSJT-X User Guide.

Depending on what code revision you upgrade from, it may be necessary 
to do a one-time reset of the default list of suggested operating 
frequencies.  Go to *File->Settings->Frequencies*, right click on 
the table and select *Reset*. 


		Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0
		-----------------------------

NEW FEATURES IN WSJT-X Version 1.8.0
------------------------------------

1.  New mode called FT8: sensitivity down to -20 dB on the AWGN
    channel; QSOs 4 times faster than JT65 or JT9; auto-sequencing
    includes an option to respond automatically to first decoded
    reply to your CQ.

2.  New mode for accurate Frequency Calibration of your radio.

3.  Improved performance of decoders for JT65, QRA64, and MSK144.
    MSK144 includes facilities for amplitide and phase equalization
    and an "SWL" mode for short-format messages.
    
4.  Options to minimize screen space used by Main and Wide Graph
    windows.
    
5.  Enhanced management scheme for table of operating frequencies, and
    a new set of default frequencies specific to the three IARU
    Regions.
    
6.  Improved CAT control for many rigs, including those controlled
    through Commander or OmniRig.
    
7.  New keyboard shortcuts to set "Tx even/1st" ON or OFF.

8.  A number of (mostly minor) bug fixes and tweaks to the user
    interface.  For example: new behavior for the audio level slider;
    correctly logged QSO start times in certain situations; correct
    control of FT-891/991 and some other radios via rigctld.

At the time of the v1.8.0-rc1 release the following tasks are yet to
be completed:

1.  Updates to WSJT-X User Guide.
2.  Sample files for FT8.
3.  Enhanced decoding using AP ("a priori") information.
4.  Signal subtraction and multi-pass decoding.
5.  Option to Auto-respond to the weakest responder to your CQ.


Installation packages for Windows, Linux, OS X, and Raspbian can be 
downloaded from the WSJT web site:

		Brief Description of the FT8 Protocol
		-------------------------------------

WSJT-X Version 1.8.0 includes a new mode called FT8, developed by K9AN
and K1JT.  The mode name "FT8" stands for "Franke and Taylor, 8-FSK
modulation".  FT8 uses 15-second T/R sequences and provides 50% or
better decoding probability down to -20 dB on an AWGN channel.  An
auto-sequencing facility includes an option to respond automatically
to the first decoded reply to your CQ.  FT8 QSOs are 4 times faster
than those made with JT65 or JT9.  FT8 is an excellent mode for HF
DXing and for situations like multi-hop E_s on 6 meters, where deep
QSB may make fast and reliable completion of QSOs desirable.

Some important characteristics of FT8:

  - T/R sequence length: 15 s
  - Message length: 75 bits + 12-bit CRC
  - FEC code: LDPC(174,87)
  - Modulation: 8-FSK, tone spacing 6.25 Hz
  - Constant-envelope waveform
  - Occupied bandwidth: 50 Hz
  - Synchronization: 7x7 Costas arrays at start, middle, and end
  - Transmission duration: 79*1920/12000 = 12.64 s
  - Decoding threshold: -20 dB; several dB lower with AP decoding
  - Multi-decoder finds and decodes all FT8 signals in passband
  - Optional auto-sequencing and auto-reply to a CQ response
  - Operational behavior similar to JT9, JT65

We plan to implement signal subtraction, two-pass decoding, and use of
a priori (AP) information in the decoder.  These features are not yet
activated in v1.8.0.

We haven't yet finalized what the three extra bits in the message
payload will be used for.  Suggestions are welcome!
