 * WSJT-X Message Formats
 * ======================
 *
 * All messages are written or  read using the QDataStream derivatives
 * defined below, note that we are using the default for floating
 * point precision which means all are double precision i.e. 64-bit
 * IEEE format.
 *
 *  Message is big endian format
 *
 *   Header format:
 *
 *      32-bit unsigned integer magic number 0xadbccbda
 *      32-bit unsigned integer schema number
 *
 *   Payload format:
 *
 *      As per  the QDataStream format,  see below for version  used and
 *      here:
 *
 *        http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/datastreamformat.html
 *
 *      for the serialization details for each type, at the time of
 *      writing the above document is for Qt_5_0 format which is buggy
 *      so we use Qt_5_4 format, differences are:
 *
 *      QDateTime:
 *           QDate      qint64    Julian day number
 *           QTime      quint32   Milli-seconds since midnight
 *           timespec   quint8    0=local, 1=UTC, 2=Offset from UTC
 *                                                 (seconds)
 *                                3=time zone
 *           offset     qint32    only present if timespec=2
 *           timezone   several-fields only present if timespec=3
 *
 *      we will avoid using QDateTime fields with time zones for simplicity.
 *
 * Type utf8  is a  utf-8 byte  string formatted  as a  QByteArray for
 * serialization purposes  (currently a quint32 size  followed by size
 * bytes, no terminator is present or counted).
 *
 * The QDataStream format document linked above is not complete for
 * the QByteArray serialization format, it is similar to the QString
 * serialization format in that it differentiates between empty
 * strings and null strings. Empty strings have a length of zero
 * whereas null strings have a length field of 0xffffffff.
 *
 * Schema Negotiation
 * ------------------
 *
 * The NetworkMessage::Builder  class specifies a schema  number which
 * may be  incremented from time to  time. It represents a  version of
 * the underlying encoding schemes used to store data items. Since the
 * underlying  encoding  is   defined  by  the  Qt   project  in  it's
 * QDataStream  stream operators,  it  is essential  that clients  and
 * servers  of  this protocol  can  agree  on  a common  scheme.   The
 * NetworkMessage  utility classes  below exchange  the schema  number
 * actually used.  The handling of  the schema is backwards compatible
 * to  an  extent,  so  long   as  clients  and  servers  are  written
 * correctly. For  example a server  written to any  particular schema
 * version can communicate with a client written to a later schema.
 *
 * Schema Version 1:- this schema used the QDataStream::Qt_5_0 version
 *  which is broken.
 *
 * Schema Version 2:- this schema uses the QDataStream::Qt_5_2 version.
 *
 * Schema Version 3:- this schema uses the QDataStream::Qt_5_4 version.
 *
 *
 *
 * Message       Direction Value                  Type
 * ------------- --------- ---------------------- -----------
 * Heartbeat     Out/In    0                      quint32
 *                         Id (unique key)        utf8
 *                         Maximum schema number  quint32
 *                         version                utf8
 *                         revision               utf8
 *
 *    The heartbeat  message shall be  sent on a periodic  basis every
 *    NetworkMessage::pulse   seconds   (see    below),   the   WSJT-X
 *    application  does  that  using the  MessageClient  class.   This
 *    message is intended to be used by servers to detect the presence
 *    of a  client and also  the unexpected disappearance of  a client
 *    and  by clients  to learn  the schema  negotiated by  the server
 *    after it receives  the initial heartbeat message  from a client.
 *    The message_aggregator reference server does just that using the
 *    MessageServer class. Upon  initial startup a client  must send a
 *    heartbeat message as soon as  is practical, this message is used
 *    to negotiate the maximum schema  number common to the client and
 *    server. Note  that the  server may  not be  able to  support the
 *    client's  requested maximum  schema  number, in  which case  the
 *    first  message received  from the  server will  specify a  lower
 *    schema number (never a higher one  as that is not allowed). If a
 *    server replies  with a lower  schema number then no  higher than
 *    that number shall be used for all further outgoing messages from
 *    either clients or the server itself.
 *
 *    Note: the  "Maximum schema number"  field was introduced  at the
 *    same time as schema 3, therefore servers and clients must assume
 *    schema 2 is the highest schema number supported if the Heartbeat
 *    message does not contain the "Maximum schema number" field.

 *
 *    WSJT-X  sends this  status message  when various  internal state
 *    changes to allow the server to  track the relevant state of each
 *    client without the need for  polling commands. The current state
 *    changes that generate status messages are:
 *
 *      Application start up,
 *      "Enable Tx" button status changes,
 *      Dial frequency changes,
 *      Changes to the "DX Call" field,
 *      Operating mode, sub-mode or fast mode changes,
 *      Transmit mode changed (in dual JT9+JT65 mode),
 *      Changes to the "Rpt" spinner,
 *      After an old decodes replay sequence (see Replay below),
 *      When switching between Tx and Rx mode,
 *      At the start and end of decoding,
 *      When the Rx DF changes,
 *      When the Tx DF changes,
 *      When settings are exited,
 *      When the DX call or grid changes,
 *      When the Tx watchdog is set or reset.
 *
 *    The Special operation mode is  an enumeration that indicates the
 *    setting  selected  in  the  WSJT-X  "Settings->Advanced->Special
 *    operating activity" panel. The values are as follows:
 *
 *       0 -> NONE
 *       1 -> NA VHF
 *       2 -> EU VHF

 *
 *      The decode message is sent when  a new decode is completed, in
 *      this case the 'New' field is true. It is also used in response
 *      to  a "Replay"  message where  each  old decode  in the  "Band
 *      activity" window, that  has not been erased, is  sent in order
 *      as a one of these messages  with the 'New' field set to false.
 *      See  the "Replay"  message below  for details  of usage.   Low
 *      confidence decodes are flagged  in protocols where the decoder
 *      has knows that  a decode has a higher  than normal probability
 *      of  being  false, they  should  not  be reported  on  publicly
 *      accessible services  without some attached warning  or further
 *      validation. Off air decodes are those that result from playing
 *      back a .WAV file.

 *      This message is  send when all prior "Decode"  messages in the
 *      "Band Activity"  window have been discarded  and therefore are
 *      no long available for actioning  with a "Reply" message. It is
 *      sent when the user erases  the "Band activity" window and when
 *      WSJT-X  closes down  normally. The  server should  discard all
 *      decode messages upon receipt of this message.
 *
 *      It may  also be  sent to  a WSJT-X instance  in which  case it
 *      clears one or  both of the "Band Activity"  and "Rx Frequency"
 *      windows.  The Window  argument  can be  one  of the  following
 *      values:
 *
 *         0  - clear the "Band Activity" window (default)
 *         1  - clear the "Rx Frequency" window
 *         2  - clear both "Band Activity" and "Rx Frequency" windows

 *
 *      In order for a server  to provide a useful cooperative service
 *      to WSJT-X it  is possible for it to initiate  a QSO by sending
 *      this message to a client. WSJT-X filters this message and only
 *      acts upon it  if the message exactly describes  a prior decode
 *      and that decode  is a CQ or QRZ message.   The action taken is
 *      exactly equivalent to the user  double clicking the message in
 *      the "Band activity" window. The  intent of this message is for
 *      servers to be able to provide an advanced look up of potential
 *      QSO partners, for example determining if they have been worked
 *      before  or if  working them  may advance  some objective  like
 *      award progress.  The  intention is not to  provide a secondary
 *      user  interface for  WSJT-X,  it is  expected  that after  QSO
 *      initiation the rest  of the QSO is carried  out manually using
 *      the normal WSJT-X user interface.
 *
 *      The  Modifiers   field  allows  the  equivalent   of  keyboard
 *      modifiers to be sent "as if" those modifier keys where pressed
 *      while  double-clicking  the  specified  decoded  message.  The
 *      modifier values (hexadecimal) are as follows:
 *
 *          no modifier     0x00
 *          SHIFT           0x02

 *
 *      When a server starts it may  be useful for it to determine the
 *      state  of preexisting  clients. Sending  this message  to each
 *      client as it is discovered  will cause that client (WSJT-X) to
 *      send a "Decode" message for each decode currently in its "Band
 *      activity"  window. Each  "Decode" message  sent will  have the
 *      "New" flag set to false so that they can be distinguished from
 *      new decodes. After  all the old decodes have  been broadcast a
 *      "Status" message  is also broadcast.  If the server  wishes to
 *      determine  the  status  of  a newly  discovered  client;  this
 *      message should be used.

 *
 *      This message  allows the server  to set the current  free text
 *      message content. Sending this  message with a non-empty "Text"
 *      field is equivalent to typing  a new message (old contents are
 *      discarded) in to  the WSJT-X free text message  field or "Tx5"
 *      field (both  are updated) and if  the "Send" flag is  set then
 *      clicking the "Now" radio button for the "Tx5" field if tab one
 *      is current or clicking the "Free  msg" radio button if tab two
 *      is current.
 *
 *      It is the responsibility of the  sender to limit the length of
 *      the  message   text  and   to  limit   it  to   legal  message
 *      characters. Despite this,  it may be difficult  for the sender
 *      to determine the maximum message length without reimplementing
 *      the complete message encoding protocol. Because of this is may
 *      be better  to allow any  reasonable message length and  to let
 *      the WSJT-X application encode and possibly truncate the actual
 *      on-air message.
 *
 *      If the  message text is  empty the  meaning of the  message is
 *      refined  to send  the  current free  text  unchanged when  the
 *      "Send" flag is set or to  clear the current free text when the
 *      "Send" flag is  unset.  Note that this API does  not include a
 *      command to  determine the  contents of  the current  free text
 *      message.

 *
 *      This  message allows  the server  to set  the current  current
 *      geographical location  of operation. The supplied  location is
 *      not persistent but  is used as a  session lifetime replacement
 *      loction that overrides the Maidenhead  grid locater set in the
 *      application  settings.  The  intent  is to  allow an  external
 *      application  to  update  the  operating  location  dynamically
 *      during a mobile period of operation.
 *
 *      Currently  only Maidenhead  grid  squares  or sub-squares  are
 *      accepted, i.e.  4- or 6-digit  locators. Other formats  may be
 *      accepted in future.

 *
 *      The  logged ADIF  message is  sent to  the server(s)  when the
 *      WSJT-X user accepts the "Log  QSO" dialog by clicking the "OK"
 *      button. The  "ADIF text" field  consists of a valid  ADIF file
 *      such that  the WSJT-X  UDP header information  is encapsulated
 *      into a valid ADIF header. E.g.:
 *
 *          <magic-number><schema-number><type><id><32-bit-count>  # binary encoded fields
 *          # the remainder is the contents of the ADIF text field
 *          <adif_ver:5>3.0.7
 *          <programid:6>WSJT-X
 *          <EOH>
 *          ADIF log data fields ...<EOR>
 *
 *      Note that  receiving applications can treat  the whole message
 *      as a valid ADIF file with one record without special parsing.

 *
 *      The server  may send  this message at  any time.   The message
 *      specifies  the background  and foreground  color that  will be
 *      used  to  highlight  the  specified callsign  in  the  decoded
 *      messages  printed  in  the  Band Activity  panel.  The  WSJT-X
 *      clients maintain a list of such instructions and apply them to
 *      all decoded  messages in the  band activity window.   To clear
 *      highlighting send an  invalid QColor value for  either or both
 *      of the background and foreground fields.
 *
 *      The "Highlight last"  field allows the sender  to request that
 *      the  last  instance  only  instead of  all  instances  of  the
 *      specified  call  be  highlighted  or  have  it's  highlighting
 *      cleared.
