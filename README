WSJT-X implements JT9, a new mode  designed especially for the LF, MF,
and  HF bands,  as well  as  the popular  mode JT65.  Both modes  were
designed for making reliable, confirmed QSOs under extreme weak-signal
conditions.  They  use nearly  identical message structure  and source
encoding.  JT65 was  designed for  EME (“moonbounce”)  on the  VHF/UHF
bands  and   has  also  proved   very  effective  for   worldwide  QRP
communication at  HF; in contrast, JT9  is optimized for HF  and lower
frequencies. JT9 is  about 2 dB more sensitive than  JT65A while using
less  than 10%  of the  bandwidth. World-wide  QSOs are  possible with
power levels of a few watts and  compromise antennas. A 2 kHz slice of
spectrum is  essentially full when  occupied by ten JT65  signals.  As
many as 100 JT9 signals can fit into the same space, without overlap.

WSJT-X offers a “bi-lingual” operating  mode in which you can transmit
and   receive  JT65   and   JT9  signals,   switching  between   modes
automatically as  needed.  Displayed  bandwidth can be  as large  as 5
kHz. If  your receiver  has as  upper-sideband filter  at least  4 kHz
wide, you can have all the typical  JT65 and JT9 activity on screen at
once, available for  making QSOs with a click of  the mouse. Even with
standard SSB-width IF filters, switching between JT65 and JT9 modes is
quick and convenient. Be sure to read the online WSJT-X User's Guide.
